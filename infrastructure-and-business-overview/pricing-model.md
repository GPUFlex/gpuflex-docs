# Pricing Model

We choose to adopt dynamic pricingrather than fixed rates. This means our platform will have a marketplace-style pricing mechanism where supply and demand directly influence the cost of GPU instances. Key aspects of this pricing strategy:

## Bidding System and Surge Pricing

&#x20;Customers will be automatically specified their computing needs (GPU type, memory, region, etc.) after model benchmarks and can either accept the current market price or place a bid – a maximum price they’re willing to pay. Hosts similarly set a minimum price they’ll accept for their hardware. The platform’s scheduler then matches users to hosts in a way that optimizes for lowest cost available. When demand is low, prices naturally fall as hosts compete; when demand surges the pricing can rise, but only to what users are willing to bid. Dynamic pricing ensures transparency and efficiency – users pay a fair market rate and can see how it fluctuates with demand. We may implement a system of “spot” instances or variable pricing that updates periodically (for example, daily adjustments based on utilization, akin to DataCrunch’s dynamic pricing which “changes daily based on demand” ). The emphasis is on flexibility: customers can opt for the lowest-cost timeframe or GPU type if they are budget-conscious, or pay a bit more to secure an instance immediately during peak times.

## Competitive Advantage Over Fixed Pricing

By using dynamic pricing, we differentiate from Lambda Labs’ fixed-rate model. Lambda offers fixed, upfront prices for their cloud GPU instances (sold in specific server configurations) . While Lambda’s prices are relatively low versus big hyperscalers, they remain static and capacity can sell out at those rates. In contrast, our pricing will float to continuously balance the market. This has two benefits: (1) Higher Utilization – idle GPUs can drop in price to attract cost-sensitive users, ensuring hardware doesn’t sit unused. (2) Elastic Supply – hosts are incentivized to bring more hardware online when prices rise, increasing supply during high demand periods (for example, if a new AI trend emerges, more providers might join to earn the higher fees). Dynamic pricing is thus a tool for both cost-efficiency and scaling. Users also gain budget control: they might bid low for non-urgent jobs to save money, and bid higher only for urgent jobs. We will, however, present pricing clearly and possibly offer a “fixed price” option as a ceiling – similar to how DataCrunch lets users choose a fixed vs. dynamic price mode – for those who need predictability. Overall, this dynamic model keeps our service affordable and user-aligned, much as Vast.ai’s marketplace has demonstrated by significantly undercutting traditional cloud GPU costs .

## Transparency and Fairness

A core principle of our pricing system is transparency. All listing prices from hosts and the current market rates will be visible to users, promoting trust. We’ll implement safeguards against extreme volatility – e.g. smoothing sudden spikes or having maximum price caps for certain hardware – to avoid any price gouging scenarios. Our fee structure will also be transparent: the platform may take a small percentage of each transaction as revenue. Importantly, dynamic pricing aligns with our cost-efficiency priority: when hardware is abundant, users benefit from very low prices, and when hardware is scarce, the higher prices signal us (and third-party hosts) to add more capacity. This dynamic approach is a modern way to balance supply and demand, ensuring the platform remains both competitive and sustainable over the long term.\
