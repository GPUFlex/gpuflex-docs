# Conclusion: Next-Gen Cloud

By fusing marketplace model with  managed cloud principles, this hybrid business model aims to achieve all-around excellence in GPU cloud services: ultra-competitive pricing, broad scalability, and reliable performance control. We will harness an 85/15 mix of user-hosted vs. company-owned infrastructure to maximize supply and minimize costs while retaining a reliable core for critical needs. A dynamic pricing system will ensure prices stay fair and market-responsive, unlike the static rates of traditional providers, thereby attracting cost-conscious AI practitioners. And by focusing solely on cloud services (with no hardware sales distraction), we can innovate faster on the platform experience and build strong partnerships with hardware providers.

In essence, this model creates a win-win ecosystem: GPU owners get to monetize excess capacity, and users (researchers, developers, companies) get affordable access to diverse GPUs worldwide. The platform sits in the middle, facilitating these exchanges securely and efficiently, much like Vast.ai does, but with added layers of quality control and support that Lambda’s approach offers. The priority on cost, control, and scalability together means our platform could be as cheap and flexible as a decentralized marketplace, yet as reliable and user-friendly as a managed cloud service. With the AI industry’s growing demand for compute, this merged approach positions the business to scale rapidly and adapt to user needs, all while maintaining sustainable operations.

By learning from two successful models and blending their best features, this hybrid business model could carve out a unique niche in the AI cloud market – offering the cost benefits of decentralization and the assurances of an enterprise-grade cloud . The result will be a platform capable of serving everyone from indie researchers to scaling startups, fulfilling our vision of accessible, affordable, and dependable GPU computing for all.
