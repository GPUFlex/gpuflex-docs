# Next Steps (Six-Month Roadmap )

Over the next six months, GPUFlex will focus on six key initiatives to evolve from a prototype into a robust, user-friendly distributed AI training platform. These initiatives include: (1) performing internal experiments by pooling personal GPUs into a mini cloud and training real models, (2) developing a proper infrastructure orchestrator for job scheduling and resource management, (3) researching and implementing enhancements for federated learning (privacy and efficiency), (4) ensuring cross-platform support across different operating systems and hardware, (5) integrating with popular machine learning toolkits to minimize user friction, and (6) testing the system with real customers in a pilot program. Each area is detailed below, with concrete steps and references to state-of-the-art practices.

### 1. Experiment with Personal GPUs (Building a Mini GPU Cloud)

Before scaling up, the team will conduct controlled experiments by networking a handful of personal or local GPUs to simulate a mini cloud environment. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end training of a model across multiple volunteer GPU nodes and uncover any immediate issues in distribution, networking, or performance. Leveraging underutilized GPUs in this way mirrors how decentralized networks aggregate spare computing power to form a cost-effective cloud . These experiments will validate the core concept of GPUFlex on a small scale.\


### 2. Develop the Infrastructure Orchestrator

A core development focus is creating a robust orchestrator – the system component that schedules tasks, dispatches data shards, and manages the life cycle of distributed jobs across all contributor nodes. In the next six months, the team will build a prototype orchestrator and evolve it towards a production-ready scheduler. This involves adopting best practices from cluster management and distributed computing frameworks.



### 3. Research & Enhance Federated Training Approaches

To differentiate GPUFlex and open it up to privacy-sensitive use cases, the team will experiment with advanced Federated Learning (FL) techniques and progressively incorporate them. Federated learning allows model training on data that remains on users’ local machines – an important feature for domains like healthcare or any scenario with private datasets. Enhancing GPUFlex with federated capabilities involves both algorithm research and engineering for privacy.



### 4. Cross-Platform Support Implementation

To maximize the pool of contributors and make GPUFlex truly ubiquitous, the software must run on multiple platforms and GPU hardware types. The plan is to achieve solid support for Linux (likely the primary environment for servers and many contributors), Windows (important because many consumer GPUs are on Windows gaming PCs), and possibly MacOs. Cross-platform support also extends to different GPU drivers (NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm, etc.). The development will focus on reducing friction for contributors on any system.



### 5. Integration with ML Toolkits for Minimal User Friction

To drive adoption, GPUFlex must integrate seamlessly with existing machine learning tools and workflows. Researchers and developers should be able to use GPUFlex as easily as they would use a local training script or a cloud training service. In the next six months, efforts will be made to provide simple interfaces (APIs or configuration files) and compatibility with popular ML frameworks, experiment tracking systems, and pipeline tools.



### 6. Pilot Testing with Real Users (Beta Launch)

Finally, the roadmap culminates in testing GPUFlex with real customers or end-users in a pilot program. After internal testing and iterative improvements from steps 1–5, engaging actual users (research labs, developers, or a friendly subset of the community) is crucial to gather feedback and validate the system in production-like scenarios. This pilot will run as a limited beta release of GPUFlex.



In summary, the six-month roadmap for GPUFlex is ambitious yet feasible. It starts with hands-on experimentation on a small scale to validate the distributed training concept, then swiftly moves to building out the core orchestration infrastructure. In parallel, advanced research into federated learning will lay the groundwork for privacy-preserving features that set GPUFlex apart. The plan also emphasizes practical engineering tasks like cross-platform operability and integration with existing ML tools – critical for user adoption. Finally, a controlled pilot with real users will ensure that by the end of this period, GPUFlex is not just a theoretical system, but a battle-tested platform ready for broader use. By following this roadmap, GPUFlex aims to evolve into a scalable, flexible, and user-friendly distributed AI training network, turning the vision of “a globally scalable, collaborative GPU cloud” into an actionable reality .
